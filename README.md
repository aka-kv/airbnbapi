Airbnb API is not publicly available so made an in house web scraping solution for hosts to know about their competitor properties.
Used network interceptio scraping and pther API development practices like rate limiting, async etc..
An API in Python that takes an airbnb room ID as input and gives me the following information 
- occupancy % over the next 5 months 
- Average night rates, highest and lowest over the next 30 days
